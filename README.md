# Environmental Impact Tracker

## Overview
The "Environmental Impact Tracker" is a C++ program made to assist in tracking, calculating, and visualizing environmental impact data in the real world. The program allows users to input data regarding carbon emissions, energy usage, and waste production, calculate their environmental impact scores, and view all the data. The goal is to create awareness about environmental concerns and encourage better decision-making for a sustainable future.

## Features
- Add Environmental Data Entry: Users can input environmental data for different companies or entities.
- Calculate Environmental Impact: The program calculates the environmental impact score in Environmental Impact Units (EIU) based on the entered data.
- View All Entries: Users can view all the entered environmental data, including company names, carbon emissions, energy usage, and waste production.

## How to Use
1. Run the program.
2. Select from the available options:
   - Add Environmental Data Entry: Enter details for a new company's environmental data.
   - Calculate Environmental Impact: Obtain the environmental impact score for entered data.
   - View All Entries: Display all the environmental data entries.
   - Exit: Quit the program.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- C++ compiler installed.

### Running the Program
1. Compile the source code file (main.cpp) using a C++ compiler.
2. Run the compiled executable file.

## Notes
- For simplicity, this program uses Environmental Impact Units (EIU) as a measure of environmental impact, calculated as the average of carbon emissions, energy usage, and waste production for each entry.
- The code structure is designed for educational purposes, demonstrating fundamental concepts in C++ programming.
